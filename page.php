              <h1>Committee on Poetry, A Brief History</h1>
              <p>The Committee On Poetry, Inc., was established in 1966 as a non-profit, arts (primarily literary) grant giving organization with three objectives:  first, to assist artists in the completion of literary work; second, to help actualize special projects such as a publication or a performance; third, to provide emergency grants-in-aid to artists.  The Board of Directors on a case-by-case basis considers applications made to the Committee On Poetry, Inc.</p>  
              <p>The Committee On Poetry, Inc. has existed for over 50 years using its low profile, friendly manner, and confidential record to help countless writers and artists finish projects, forestall evictions, obtain medical attention, and in a myriad of ways maintain artists’ existence. The recipients do not belong to any single "school" or clique of writers or artists.</p>
              <p>In the 1970's, The Committee On Poetry, Inc. expanded to include organizing festivals of bilingual poetry readings in New York City.  These weeklong conferences allowed meaningful personal exchanges and often resulted in many new translations. The international organizing arm of the Committee on Poetry, Inc., was the Committee for International Poetry.  Since 1988, the Committee On Poetry, Inc. has sponsored The Rainbow Body of Poetry Reading Series at Brooklyn College, and The Jewish Writers Workshop at the Town Village Synagogue.  Committee on Poetry, Inc. established the Harry Smith Archives in 1991.  In August 1996, Committee On Poetry sponsored its fourth annual Charlie Parker Festival in Tompkins Square, Manhattan.  Since 2003, Committee on Poetry has been America’s sponsor for the poetry magazine Van Gogh’s Ear.  In 2003, Committee On Poetry sponsored the first Howl Festival in New York’s Tompkins Square.  In 2004 it sponsored “By the Waters of Manhattan: Talks on Jewish Poets” and currently is assisting in Japanese Poet Nanao Sakaki, assisting Big Bridge Poetry Journal and research for Poet Philip Whalen’s Selected Letters.</p>
              <p>A partial list of poets, writers and thinkers assisted include Harry Smith, Ed Sanders, Diane Di Prima, Philip Whalen, Herbert Huncke, James Schuyler, Anne Waldman, Bernadette Mayer, Hattie Gossett, Simon Pettet, Michael Rothenberg, Amiri Baraka, and Lenny Bruce.</p>
