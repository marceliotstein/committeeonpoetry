# This is a blankslate child theme for committeeonpoetry.org
#
# Committee On Poetry is a very simple one page site. The only reason I used WordPress is to use
# its excellent Instagram Feed plugin, which is better than any free non-WordPress alternative.
#
# Since this is a simple one-page site, the content is burned directly into the page.php template, and 
# modifications are kept to a minimum. Normal WP content management is not used on this site.
