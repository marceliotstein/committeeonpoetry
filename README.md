# Blankslate-Child for CommitteeOnPoetry.org

This is a blankslate child theme for committeeonpoetry.org

Committee On Poetry is a very simple one page site. The only reason I used WordPress is to use its excellent Instagram Feed plugin, which is better than any free non-WordPress alternative.

Since this is a simple one-page site, the content is burned directly into the page.php template, and modifications are kept to a minimum. Normal WP content management is not used on this site.
